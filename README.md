# Eagleye Multi-Platform Development Architecture

In foreign countries, Windows, Mac, and Linux are used in various ways.
The US Digital Guardian and European CoSoSys are leading the global media control security S/W market, with a focus on global security company Symantec.
Eagleye is the only company in Korea to compete in the domestic market with products of foreign competitors.
Domestic security S/W developers, excluding SAFEZONE, develop technologies dependent only on the MS operating system, so there is a wide gap in security S/W development technologies supporting multi-OS (Linux) platforms.
The above figure is a development architecture to use to support Multi-OS Platform in Eagleye.

# Privacy configuration for open OS (driver, firmware and embedded S/W development)

In Korea, attempts are continuing to overcome technology dependency, which is highly dependent on MS Windows OS.
It must be installed in the open operating system (Cloud OS, Tmax OS, Harmonica OS), which is first introduced to the Internet network PC of public institutions, to access the secure cloud work environment.
Therefore, it is urgent to develop security SW (vaccine, personal information leakage prevention (DLP), etc.) technology.
With the replacement of the new OS to replace Windows 7, which ended on January 14, 2020, public and private organizations are suffering from huge costs of hundreds of billions of dollars.
In this situation, the new alternative of open OS becomes the expected effect of preventing foreign currency outflow in the domestic economy and industry and creating new jobs in the new IT software industry.
